# Assessment Brief: DataBreachTrackerAPI

## Introduction

This project fulfills the requirements of the Java API Assessment by implementing a RESTful API using Java and Spring Boot. The API is designed to track and display data breaches, making cybersecurity incident information accessible to both technical and everyday users.

---

## Assessment Objectives

- **Design and Architect APIs:** Thoughtfully plan data flow and endpoint interactions.
- **Implement Best Practices:** Adhere to Java and Spring Boot standards, error handling, and optimal project structure.
- **Code Integration:** Integrate custom code with Spring Initializr.
- **Exception Management:** Efficiently handle errors for a robust API.
- **Repository Management:** Practice effective version control and maintain a detailed, helpful README.

---

## Project Requirements

- **Framework & Language:** Java, Spring Boot
- **Data Storage:** MySQL database, with a provided database dump (`db-dump.sql`)
- **Endpoints:**
  - At least one GET endpoint with filterable results via Spring Data JPA (custom/derived)
  - Full CRUD support (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Good use of HTTP methods and request/response patterns
- **Testing:** Unit tests for at least one class
- **Exception Handling:** Comprehensive error management and informative feedback
- **Inheritance:** Evidence of inheritance in class design

---

## Deliverables

- Fully functional Java Spring Boot API with all required endpoints
- MySQL database dump file (`db-dump.sql`) in the root of the repository
- Detailed `README.md` with setup, usage, and database import instructions
- Code demonstrating exception handling and inheritance
- Unit tests included and instructions on how to run them
- All code and documentation committed to the main branch before the deadline

---

## Implementation Highlights

- **Endpoints** support filtered queries, full CRUD, and follow HTTP best practices.
- **Error Handling** is implemented via global and controller-specific exception handlers.
- **Inheritance** is demonstrated in the entity or service layer.
- **Testing** includes unit tests for key components.
- **Database**: All data stored in MySQL with a sample dump file provided for easy setup.

## Setup Instructions (Summary)

1. Install JDK 21+, MySQL, Git, and VS Code with Java/Spring extensions.
2. Clone the repository and import the database using `db-dump.sql`.
3. Update application properties with your database credentials.
4. Build and run the application (`./mvnw spring-boot:run` or from your IDE).
5. See `README.md` for complete instructions.

## Notes

- Frequent commits and meaningful messages are used throughout development.
- The API is built for clarity, maintainability, and accessibility.
- The project is suitable for demonstration, learning, or extension.
