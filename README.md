# 🚀 Setup Instructions

  ### 1. Clone the repository

      git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataBreachTracker-API.git

      cd DataBreachTracker-API

  ### 2. Import the database

      Run the provided SQL dump file into MySQL:

      mysql -u <your-username> -p databreachtracker < db-dump.sql

  ### 3. Configure database credentials

    The main configuration is in application.properties:

    # APPLICATION 
    spring.application.name=DataBreachTracker
    server.port=8080

    # DATABASE CONFIGURATION
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databreachtracker?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    spring.config.import=local.properties   # Database credentials are stored here (not committed to GitHub)

    # HIBERNATE CONFIGURATION
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true

    👉 Important: 
      Create a file called local.properties in the root of your project with your MySQL username and password:

      spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
      spring.datasource.password=yourPassword

    ⛔️ It should be excluded via .gitignore 

  ### 4. Run the application
